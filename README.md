# Smart Home on K3s

A production-ready, fully local home automation system built on Kubernetes (K3s). This project demonstrates how to create a modern, secure, and scalable smart home infrastructure using GitOps principles, Tailscale VPN, and comprehensive monitoring - all while keeping your data private and under your control.

## üåü Overview

Transform your home into a smart living space with this enterprise-grade setup that prioritizes:
- Local-first architecture (no cloud dependencies)
- Security and privacy through Tailscale VPN
- GitOps-driven deployments with ArgoCD
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Scalable Kubernetes (K3s) foundation

## üèó Infrastructure

### Hardware Setup
- **Core System**: Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM)
- **Storage**: 1TB NVMe SSD for high-performance data access
- **Power**: CyberPower CP900EPFCLCD UPS for continuous operation
- **Network**: Wired CAT8 Ethernet for reliable connectivity
- **Zigbee**: SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus (coordinator)
