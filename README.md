# üè† Smart Home on K3s

A powerful home automation system running on Kubernetes, built with privacy and local control at its heart. All your smart home needs running on a Raspberry Pi - no cloud required!

## ‚ú® What's This All About?

I've built a modern smart home system that:
- Runs 100% locally (no cloud dependencies)
- Keeps your data private and secure
- Uses enterprise-grade tech (Kubernetes) in a home setting
- Provides fancy features like adaptive lighting and power monitoring
- Scales beautifully as you add more devices

Perfect for both tech enthusiasts looking to self-host their smart home AND anyone wanting a reliable, private home automation setup.

## üõ† Current Setup
